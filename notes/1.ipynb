    "> — Arthur Samuel, 1959\n",

    "One of the main advantages of machine learning over traditional programming is the fact that, once a machine learning system has been built, it can modify how it works in response to changing data without being programmed to do so. This makes machine learning systems more resilient in changing environments, while requiring less effort on the part of the programmer.\n",

    "Lastly, the fact that machine learning can extract patterns over large quantities of data, which could never be analyzed by a person or many, means that, by studying how machine learning systems are trained on the data, we can obtain valuable information about it. This is called **data mining**."

For instance, emails used to train a spam detection filter will be given to the model labeled as spam or ham. This is known as **supervised learning**, as the model is given information as to what the data should be classified as. The values from which the machine learning system is supposed to extract the desired value are called **features** or **attributes**, and the desired values are called **labels** or **objectives**. For example, a car price prediction system might use as labels the car's motor type, brand and fuel consumption as features, while the car price would be its objective.\n",

This means each step of the training is fast and computationally light, which allows it to be performed online and in low resource machines.\n",

Their **learning rate** determines how quickly they adapt to new data, giving us more rapidly changing or more conservative online learning models. This changing performance in response to new data can become a problem, as bad data (perhaps due to a technical failure or a malicious attack) can degrade the system's performance in real time, which will be noticed by users. Therefore, we ought to monitor the system closely and be very careful about which data enters it, even stopping the learning if we notice any significant degradation."
