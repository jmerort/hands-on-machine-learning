    "> [Machine learning] is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  \n",
    "> — Arthur Samuel, 1959\n",
    "\n",
    "> A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to a task **T** and a performance measure **R**, if its performance at **T**, as measured by **R**, improves with experience **E**.  \n",

    "One of the main advantages of machine learning over traditional programming is the fact that, once a machine learning system has been built, it can modify how it works in response to changing data without being programmed to do so. This makes machine learning systems more resilient in changing environments, while requiring less effort on the part of the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many problems for which an algorithm either hasn't been or can't be effectively developed, and thus can only be properly handeled using machine learning methods. Among such problems are image and speech recongition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the fact that machine learning can extract patterns over large quantities of data, which could never be analyzed by a person or many, means that, by studying how machine learning systems are trained on the data, we can obtain valuable information about it. This is called **data mining**."
